The course 'Marine Ecological Modelling and Global Climate Change' was designed as an elective course within the Master programme Marine Biology at the University of Algarve.<br>

* Scope<br>
The course covers the interactions and potential impacts of global climate changes (past, ongoing and future) on different levels of marine biodiversity. It is mostly hands­-on oriented, with a strong component on biodiversity and climate data acquisition, management and visualisation (e.g., the new Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios of climate change), as well as on ecological modelling using state of the art mechanistic and correlative approaches (e.g., machine learning algorithms).<br>

* Target audience<br>
The course is targeted to MSc and PhD students in the fields of marine biology, ecology, conservation and evolution. Students must be fluent in English and have some basic knowledge on marine ecology, statistics and R computing language (although not mandatory). Students are highly encouraged to bring their own datasets (if data are not available, the professor will provide own data).<br>

* Topics<br>
Exploring interactions and potential impacts of global climate changes (past, ongoing and future) on different levels of marine biodiversity.<br>

* Goals<br>
Get to know the foundations of ecological niche theory and marine macroecology;<br>
Develop skills on marine biodiversity and climate data acquisition, management and visualisation;<br>
Develop skills on correlative ecological niche modelling (ENM);<br>
Understand the strengths of ENM and the concept of transferability across space and time;<br>
Develop skills on good practice ENM following proper parametization and evaluation of predictive performances;<br>
Get to know how to discuss the results of ENM and the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of marine biodiversity, and defend them to a wide audience.<br><br>
