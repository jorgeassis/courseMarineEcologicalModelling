## Marine ecological niche modelling and global climate change
### [Evaluation]

#### Individual research study

Each student will conduct an individual research study addressing (1) the interactions OR (2) the impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity. The students can choose one of the following topics:

[1] Identify the main climatic drivers shaping the distribution of one or more marine species;<br>
[2] Predict present distributional ranges for one or more marine species;<br>
[3] Project future range shifts for one or more marine species;<br>
[4] Predict potential marine invasion processes for one or more marine species;<br>
[0] Additional topics can be proposed (in such case, please contact the professor).<br><br>

To successfully conduct the individual research study, the students must perform the following tasks:

[1] Gather biodiversity data for one or more marine species [Practical session S04];<br>
[2] Gather environmental data to model the distribution of one or more marine species [Practical session S04];<br>
[3] Model the distribution of one or more marine species and conduct one of the topics addressing the interactions or impacts of climate changes on marine biodiversity;<br>
[4] Write a report with the major results and findings;<br>
[5] Document the R script used to conduct the analyses and provide it as supplementary information of the report;<br><br>

The report should be made as an R Markdown file with the following **format**:

[1] Abstract: What did I do in a nutshell? (max. 200 words)<br>
[2] Introduction: What is the problem?<br>
[3] Methods: Brief statement on how did I solve the problem?<br>
[4] Code and Figures
[5] Results: Brief statement on what did I find out?<br>
[6] Discussion: Brief statement on what does it mean?<br>
[7] References: Whose work did I refer to?<br>

To successfully write the report, the students must:

[1] Formulate a relevant research ecological question (e.g., in the scope of climate change impacts);<br>
[2] Formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature;<br>
[3] Build a conceptual model to address the research question in their study system;<br>
[4] Read the scientific literature in a systematic, quantitative way, to collect, assess the evidence for the different components of their model and hypotheses, and formulate conclusions and recommendations.<br><br>

#### Major milestones

[26 May] Speed talks (5 minutes) + Brief discussion (5 minutes).<br>
The student will perform a presentation where they show the major findings of their research study addressing the interactions or impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity.<br><br>

[15 Jun] Final report (R markdown format).<br>
The students must send the final report to jmassis@ualg.pt.<br><br>

#### Mid-term exam

[26 May] Multiple choice exam (up to 90 minutes) with up to 4 essay questions.<br>
The student must achieve, at least, 9.5 out of 20.<br>
